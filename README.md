ATLauncher is a Launcher for Minecraft which integrates multiple different ModPacks to allow you to download and install ModPacks easily and quickly.

### Coding Standards

+ Please keep all line lengths to 120 characters and use 4 spaces rather than tab characters
+ Please keep all variables at the top of the class
+ Please keep all inner classes at the bottom
+ Please don't use star imports
+ Please mark all classes that are to be de/serialized with Gson with the @Json annotation for other developers
+ Please use the IntelliJ-Coding-Style.xml for the project (if using IntelliJ) in order to keep all formatting consistent
+ Please update the CHANGELOG.md file when fixing/adding something so it's easier to keep track of than git commits. Feel free to add in a 'by MyUsername' to the end of the changes you've made.
+ Please don't do large commits. My preference is a single commit for a single fix/addition rather than bundled up commits.
