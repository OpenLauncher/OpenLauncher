## Versioning System

Starting with version 3.2.1.0 a new versioning system was put into place. It works off the following:

Reserved.Major.Minor.Revision

So for 3.2.1.0 the major number is 2 and minor number is 1 and revision number is 0. Reserved is used as a base, only incremented on complete rewrites.

Major should be incremented when large changes/features are made.

Minor should be incremented when small changes/features are made.

Revision should be incremented when there are no new features and only contains bug fixes for the previous minor.
